# Flappy Bird Blazor

This re-creation of Flappy Bird is created in [.NET Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).

That's a cross-platform video game running on .NET, purely in your browser! No Silverlight, ActiveX, Flash or Shockwave needed! What a time to be alive!

This was created following [Erin Mclaughlin's Blazor tutorial](https://github.com/blazorbuilds/Flappy-Bird) which itself is based on [Ania Kubow's vanilla JavaScript project](https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-bird).

## Build

```powershell
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
dotnet build
