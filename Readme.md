# Flappy Bird Blazor

Flappy bird created in .Net Core Blazor Web Assembly.

That's a cross-platform video game running on .Net, purely in your browser! No Silverlight, ActiveX, Flash or Shockwave needed! What a time to be alive.

This was created following [Erin Mclaughlin's Blazor tutorial](https://github.com/blazorbuilds/Flappy-Bird) which itself is based on [Ania Kubow's vanilla JavaScript project](https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-bird).
